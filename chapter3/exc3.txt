0096 // Octal constants can only contain integers between 0 and 7
0x10.5 // Hexadecimal floats require a exponent (e.g. 0x10.5p2 where 0x is a prefix indicating a hexadecimal value, 10.5 is the significand, and p2 indicates 10 to the power of 2)
98.7U // Invalid suffix U on a floating constant
1.2Fe-7 // Invalid suffix Fe-7 on a floating constant (1.2e-7 would be valid, don't need a F suffix on a literal floating constant)
0X0G1 // Hexadecimal integer can only include characters from A - F
17777s // An integer can only be followed by the suffix' u, U, l, or L
