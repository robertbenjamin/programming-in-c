# Programming in C

_The Gitbook for this repo is currently in the early stages, please don't expect everything to work properly._

This repo contains the exercises and example programs from Stephen G. Kochan's "Programming in C" book. This readme will be updated as I work through the book and complete the exercises. Once finished, I plan to go back through and put together a summary of each chapter, bullet-point style!
