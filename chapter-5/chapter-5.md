# Chapter 4
#### *Making Decisions*

## Exercises

### 1.

Type in and run the twelve programs presented in this chapter.

- [Program 5.1](program-5-1.c)
- [Program 5.2](program-5-2.c)
- [Program 5.3](program-5-3.c)
- [Program 5.4](program-5-4.c)
- [Program 5.5](program-5-5.c)
- [Program 5.6](program-5-6.c)
- [Program 5.7](program-5-7.c)
- [Program 5.8](program-5-8.c)
- [Program 5.8.a](program-5-8-a.c)
- [Program 5.9](program-5-9.c)
- [Program 5.10](program-5-10.c)
- [Program 5.10.a](program-5-10-a.c)

### 2.

Write a program that takes two numbers from user input and tells the user whether if the first is evenly divisible by the second.

- [Exercise 5.2](exercise-5-2.c)


### 3.

Write a program that takes in to integers and displays the results of dividing the first by the second, to three-decimal-place accuracy.

- [Exercise 5.3](exercise-5-3.c)

### 4.

Write a program that acts as a simple "printing" calculator. The program should allow the user to type in expressions of the form:

```
number  operator
```

The following operators should be recognized by the program:

```
+  -  *  /  S  E
```

`S` sets the accumulator to the entered number. `E` tells the program to end execution.

- [Exercise 5.4](exercise-5-4.c)

### 5.

[Program 4.9](../chapter-4/program-4-9.c) reverses the digits of an integer. Modify it so it works correctly with negative numbers.

- [Exercise 5.6](exercise-5-6.c)


## 6.

[Program 5.10](program-5-10.c) has several inefficiencies. The program should not check for even numbers; it also shouldn't continue to check divisors if the current number is already shown to be divisible by a smaller number. Fix these inefficiences in the program.

- [Exercise 5.7](exercise-5-7.c)
